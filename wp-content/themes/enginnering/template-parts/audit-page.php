                                    Auditing plays a vital role in the ISO certification process, serving as evidence
                                    of an organization's operational efficiency. It involves evaluating compliance and identifying potential risks to eliminate them. When a company chooses
                                    to operate based on a specific ISO management system, auditing 
                                    and certification become essential.
